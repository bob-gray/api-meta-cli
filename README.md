api-meta-cli
============

Command line utility for running locally installed api-meta
-----------------------------------------------------------

This a lightweight program that simply delegates entirely to a locally
installed [api-meta](https://github.com/bob-gray/api-meta).

For documentation about options, refer to the locally installed api-meta.

###Install

`npm install -g api-meta-cli`

This can be run anywhere and installs api-meta-cli globally giving you `api`
as a global command. api-meta must then be installed locally within a package.
